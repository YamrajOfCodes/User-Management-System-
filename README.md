## 🏗️ Architecture & Approach

### State Management

I used Redux Toolkit as the main state layer. It keeps things organized and avoids the usual Redux boilerplate.
The store is split into feature-based slices using both:

Standard reducers for simple updates

Extra reducers for async logic (API requests, CRUD operations)

This structure makes it easy to add new dashboard modules without reworking everything.

### Form Handling & Validation

**Formik + Zod** combination for robust form management:

- **Formik**: Handles form state, submissions, and field-level logic
- **Zod**: Provides type-safe validation schemas that are reusable across components
- **Consistent error handling**: Unified approach to form errors and validation messages

### UI State Management

Every async operation includes proper loading and error states:

- **Loading indicators**: Visual feedback during API calls
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **No silent failures**: The UI always reflects the actual state of operations

### Theme System

Implements a **Context API-based** theme system for dark/light mode:

- Separated from Redux to keep UI preferences isolated
- Clean toggle implementation without polluting global state
- Efficient re-renders only for theme-dependent components


💡 Challenges & Learnings
Theme System with Context API

I’m used to working with Redux, but I haven’t had much practical experience using the Context API.
For this project, I used Context specifically for the theme system (dark mode), because stuffing UI theme state into Redux didn't make sense.

At first it was a bit awkward because I’m not as familiar with Context, but building the theme toggling system forced me to actually understand how it works. By the end, it felt a lot more natural, and the theme feature ended up being cleaner than it would’ve been in Redux.
